      🚀 Introduction to Node.js & Express.js<br><br>

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine that enables developers to run JavaScript on the server side. Its event-driven and non-blocking I/O architecture allows applications to handle massive amounts of concurrent operations with impressive efficiency. This makes it ideal for real-time applications, scalable network systems, and high-performance APIs. By using JavaScript on both the frontend and backend, Node.js helps maintain a unified development workflow and reduces the complexity of working with multiple languages.<br><br>

Express.js builds on top of Node.js as a minimal yet highly flexible web framework. It simplifies backend development by providing intuitive tools for routing, middleware management, request handling, and structuring application logic. With its vast ecosystem of extensions and third-party libraries, Express makes it easy to add authentication, validation, logging, security layers, and more without unnecessary overhead. Its clean design supports both small projects and enterprise-level systems with equal ease.<br><br>

Together, Node.js and Express.js create a modern environment for building fast, reliable, and maintainable server-side applications. This combination enables developers to build RESTful APIs, microservices, real-time communication systems, dashboards, automation tools, and countless other backend solutions. Their performance, flexibility, and active community support make them a leading choice for developers aiming to create efficient and scalable web infrastructures.<br><br>

Using Node.js with Express.js not only speeds up development but also offers a future-proof foundation that continues to evolve with the JavaScript ecosystem.
